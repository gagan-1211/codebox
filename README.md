The provided code is an example of a Python script that demonstrates web scraping and data processing. It retrieves data from a specific URL and extracts relevant information from the retrieved content. The code then organizes this data into a tabular format for easy visualization and analysis.
The provided code is a Python script that performs web scraping to extract data from a specific URL. It then processes the extracted data and presents it in a tabular format.

Here's a brief description of the code:

The necessary libraries are imported: requests, json, pandas, and BeautifulSoup. These libraries are used for making HTTP requests, handling JSON data, and parsing HTML content.

The code retrieves the content from the specified URL using requests.get() and creates a BeautifulSoup object, soup, to parse the HTML.

The HTML content is converted to JSON format using json.loads(), and the relevant data is extracted and stored in the res variable.

The code initializes a dictionary called data with empty lists for the product information: name, store, best price, and link.

It iterates over the extracted data (res) and checks if the product is not upcoming (based on the "stock" value). If it's not upcoming, the product details are appended to the respective lists in the data dictionary.

To create an empty row between each product in the tabular representation, dummy values (" ") are appended to the lists in the data dictionary.

The data dictionary is used to create a pandas DataFrame, df, which organizes the extracted information in a tabular format.

The tabulate function is used to format the DataFrame df into a table, including column headers.

Finally, the formatted table is printed to the console using print(tabulate(df, showindex=False, headers=df.columns)).

Overall, this code demonstrates how to scrape data from a specific URL, extract relevant information, and present it in a structured tabular format using pandas and tabulate. The extracted information includes product names, store names, best prices, and tracking links.
